Purpose of today's workshop is to continue working on part 1 of the project.
```

## GitHub tags

To submit part 1, there are a number of things you need to do:

- Save all documents for submission in your repository.
- Create a release tag *before the deadline*.
```{caution}
Teaching team can see when you create a tag and we will check to make sure it is before the deadline.
```
- Submit the project checklist via the LMS. In the checklist, you should include the URL for the GitHub
tag you created.

```{note}
To learn how to create a tag, please see GitHub documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/managing-tags).
```

## Extra Resources for Part 1

Software modelling and design is a prerequisite for this subject, so it is expected that students are comfortable and 
familiar creating use cases and domain models. If you require more help, we recommend these books:

- Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn
- Applying UML Patterns by Craig Larman

## Team Project Work  

Now you should (in your teams):

- Continue working on part 1.
- Set up your local development environment. It is important to do this early, so we can address issues, if you 
encounter any.
- If you are new to Java, JSPs, servlets or web development, you should work through the learning resources 
provided. These will help you create your first web project using servlets and JSPs.
