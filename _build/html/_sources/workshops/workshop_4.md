# Workshop 4

```{admonition} By Now You Should Have
:class: important
- Begun work on part 2.
```

```{warning}
Some teams leave deployment to Heroku until the last week or two (after local development is complete). This
***always*** leads to problems for them, so please make sure you deploy with enough time to troubleshoot issues.
It's unlikely teaching staff will be able to provide much help, if you reach out a few days before submission.
```

## Purpose of Today's Workshop

```{note}
Part 1 results will be released within 2 weeks of submission.
```

The purpose of today's workshop is to discuss common mistakes for part 1 of the project.
