# Setup Development Environment

---

These instructions have been provided to assist your team in setting up for your assignment.

You do not need to follow these steps, if you are not using these tools, but these are the only tools supported in the 
subject. If you choose to use different tools (for example, a different IDE or server), teaching staff will not provide 
support for them.

Not all steps must be done by all team members - it is indicated under each step who needs to do it.

***Please follow the steps in order:***

### [Step 1: Install IntelliJ Professional Edition](1_intellij_install.md)
Should be done by all team members.

### [Step 2: Download Tomcat](2_tomcat_download.md)
Should be done by all team members.

### [Step 3: Setup PostgreSQL](3_postgresql_setup.md)
Should be done by all members.

### [Step 4: Create Project in IntelliJ](4_create_project.md)
Should only be done by one team member.

### [Step 5: Setup GitHub Repository](5_github_setup.md)
Should be done by the team member who did step 4.

### [Step 6: Clone GitHub Repository](6_github_clone.md)
Should be done by all team members (except the team member who did steps 4 and 5).

### [Step 7: Connect IntelliJ Project to Local PostgreSQL Instance](7_connect_intellij_postgresql.md)
Should be done by all team members.

### [Step 8: Deploy Project to Heroku](8_heroku_deploy.md)

*This does not need to be done to set up the project. You can do it now, or you can delay doing this step until you 
have started work on your project.*
