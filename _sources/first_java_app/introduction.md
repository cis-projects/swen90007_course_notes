# Introduction

For those unfamiliar with web development (and especially JSPs and Servlets), a number of guides have been created to
help you develop your first web application.

## [First Web Application](first_web_app.md)

This guide gives you an overview of the tools you will use during development (TomCat, Heroku, Maven, etc.). It 
also provides a walk-through guide to creating your first Servlet and JSP, passing parameters between Servlets and 
JSPs, and querying your application's database.

## [JSPs and Servlets](jsp_servlets.md)

In this subject, you will create an application using Java Server Pages (JSPs) and Servlets. This guide will provide 
you an overview of both.

## [Introduction to Maven](maven.md)

This guide gives you an overview of the build tool we will use this semester - Maven. It introduces Maven and how it
specifies projects using the POM file, as well as how to add dependencies in your project.

## [Introduction to Java and PostgreSQL](java_postgresql.md)

This is a demo for students who are new to using Java to query an SQL database.

## [Tools and Plugins](tools_and_plugins.md)

Some of the teaching team's favourite tools and plugins for IntelliJ to help you as you complete your project.
